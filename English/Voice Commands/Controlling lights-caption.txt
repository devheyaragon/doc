"Hello, and welcome to our tutorial on using voice

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:07,635
commands for home automation. Today, we're focusing on

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:14,191
controlling lights. This video is designed for both
professional installers and end users."

4
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:19,176
"Let's start with operating individual lighting

5
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:22,579
circuits. Imagine you have a ceiling lamp in your

6
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,898
living room. You can control this lamp by saying

7
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:29,468
'Switch on or turn off the ceiling lamp in the

8
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:32,954
living room.' This command operates the lighting

9
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:37,352
circuit named 'ceiling lamp' in the room
named 'living room.'"

10
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:41,254
"Want to dim the lights? Just say 'Set the ceiling

11
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:44,325
lamp in the living room to 50%.' This sets the

12
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:48,310
lighting circuit to 50% brightness. If you want to

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,961
make the lamp brighter, simply say 'Make the ceiling

14
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:56,110
lamp brighter.' This will increase the
brightness by 20%."

15
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,925
"Now, let's move on to operating
multiple lighting circuits.

16
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,206
You can control all the lights in a specific zone by

17
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:08,674
saying 'Turn on or switch off the light.' This

18
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:13,516
operates all lighting circuits in the configured zone
of the satellite."

19
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:16,906
"You can also specify a zone, like 'Turn on or

20
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:19,874
switch off the light in the living room.' This

21
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:23,077
operates all lighting circuits in the mentioned

22
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:26,779
zone. If you want to control all the lights in your

23
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:31,340
house, just say 'Switch on or turn off the light
everywhere.'"

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,277
"To adjust the brightness of all lights in a zone, say

25
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:38,714
'Make the light brighter' to increase brightness by

26
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:43,431
20%, or 'Set the light to 50%' to set all lights to
50% brightness.

27
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:48,696
To turn off all lights in a specific zone, say 'Turn
off the living room.'"

28
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:54,023
"Unique name recognition is a special
feature for lights.

29
00:01:54,023 --> 00:02:00,740
If the name of a light is unique across the entire
installation, you don't need to mention the room name.

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,301
But if there are several lighting circuits with the
same name, all these circuits will be operated."

31
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,124
"Also, the names 'light', 'lighting', and 'lamps' are

32
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:14,230
placeholders for all light functions in the room or

33
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,264
house. So, 'Lights on' will switch on all lighting

34
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:20,870
circuits in the room. It's not recommended to name a

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,504
lighting circuit with one of these wildcard names, as
it cannot be addressed individually."

36
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:34,689
"That's it for this tutorial on controlling lights
with voice commands in your home automation system.
