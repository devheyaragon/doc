"Hello and welcome to our tutorial on how to use voice

00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:11,123
control system for home automation. Today, we'll focus
on controlling blinds using voice commands."

3
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:16,554
"Let's start with operating individual blinds. To open

4
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:20,317
or close a roller shutter, simply say 'Open the roller

5
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:23,997
shutter' or 'Close the roller shutter'. Aragon will

6
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:30,521
move the hanging named 'roller shutter' in the current
zone to the respective end position."

7
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,450
"To extend the awning in the outdoor area, use the

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,879
command 'Extend the awning in the outdoor area'.

9
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,148
Aragon will extend the hanging named 'awning' in the
'outdoor area' zone."

10
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:47,161
"If you want to open or close the blind a little, say

11
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:50,339
'Open the blind a little' or 'Close the blind a

12
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:56,528
little'. Aragon will open or close the hanging named
'blind' in the current zone by 20%."

13
00:00:57,028 --> 00:01:00,624
"To position a hanging in a specific room to 20%, say

14
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:03,969
'Position the left blind in Living room to 20%'.

15
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,900
Aragon will set the left blind in the
Living room to 20%."

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,826
"Now, let's move on to operating several blinds. To

17
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:15,013
open or close all roller shutters, say 'Open the

18
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:18,360
roller shutters' or 'Close the roller shutters'.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,291
Aragon will move all functions defined as hanging in
the assigned zone to the respective end position."

20
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,137
"To open or close all blinds in the house, say 'Open

21
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:32,643
the blinds in the whole house' or 'Close the blinds in

22
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:35,910
the whole house'. Aragon will move all functions

23
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:41,248
defined as hanging in the entire installation to the
respective end position."

24
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:45,253
"To close all hangings in a specific room, say 'Close

25
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:50,751
the bedroom'. Aragon will close all functions defined
as hanging in the bedroom."

26
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:54,312
"Note that the names 'shutters' and 'blinds' are

27
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:57,447
placeholders for all motor drives in the room or in

28
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:00,881
the house. So, 'Raise all roller shutters' will search

29
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:05,734
for all hanging functions in the room and move them to
the upper end position."

30
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:10,788
"However, doors and gates are not addressed with these
wildcard names."

31
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:16,439
"And that's how you control blinds using Aragon's
offline voice control system."
