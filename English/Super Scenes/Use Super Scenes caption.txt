installers and end users understand and utilize this
powerful tool.

00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:16,682
Super Scenes are customizable voice commands that
automate multiple actions in your home.

5
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:22,670
They can be set up to respond to phrases like "Good
Morning", "Good Night", "I'm Home" or "I'm Leaving".

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,733
Each command can trigger a series of actions, such as

7
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:30,329
toggling lights, adjusting the thermostat, or
activating security systems.

8
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,183
To set up a Super Scenes, you'll need to select the

9
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:38,963
When-option and enter up to three voice commands that
will be executed when this command is spoken.

10
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:43,697
You can even set different variations of the command
depending on the time of day.

11
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:46,761
For example, the "I'm Home" command could turn on the

12
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:52,888
lights and start the coffee maker in the morning, but
play soft music and open the blinds in the afternoon.

13
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:58,118
Aragon offers four pre-set Super Scenes, but these can
be easily edited or customized.

14
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:04,135
To do this, simply write the command understood by
Aragon in plain text into one of the command lines.

15
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:07,216
You can also set Aragon to speak a text after calling

16
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:12,517
the Super Scenes, providing auditory confirmation that
the command has been executed.

17
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:17,461
To have Aragon speak a text, enter the keyword 'SAY',
followed by the desired text.

18
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:23,120
Remember, the Super Scenes feature is designed to be
user-friendly and easily customizable.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,129
Whether you're a professional installer or an end

20
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:31,001
user, you can tailor these commands to suit your
specific needs and preferences.

And that's how you use Super Scenes with Aragon to

22
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:37,921

automation experience.
